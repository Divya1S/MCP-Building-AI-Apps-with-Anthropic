MCP: Build Rich-Context AI Applications with Anthropic

This project demonstrates how to implement the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open protocol developed by Anthropic to standardize how Large Language Models (LLMs) access tools, data, and prompts from external sources. MCP simplifies integrating rich context into AI applications by defining a client-server architecture for communication between an MCP client (hosted in the AI app) and an MCP server (exposing tools, resources, and prompt templates). The server can run locally as a subprocess or remotely as an independent process.

Features





Standardized Integration: Connect AI applications to external data sources and tools with minimal custom integration.



Client-Server Architecture: Learn how MCP clients and servers communicate to provide LLMs with dynamic context.



Chatbot Implementation: Build an MCP-compatible chatbot with custom tools, such as searching academic papers.



Local MCP Server: Create and test a local MCP server using FastMCP, exposing tools, resources, and prompt templates.



MCP Client: Integrate an MCP client into a chatbot to connect dynamically to MCP servers.



Reference Servers: Connect to Anthropicâ€™s reference servers like filesystem (for filesystem operations) and fetch (for web content extraction as markdown).



Claude Desktop Integration: Configure Claude Desktop to connect to your MCP server and other open-source servers, abstracting low-level MCP client logic.



Remote Deployment: Deploy an MCP server remotely and test it with MCP Inspector or other MCP-compatible applications.



Future Roadmap: Explore upcoming MCP features, including multi-agent architecture, MCP registry API, server discovery, authorization, and authentication.

Prerequisites





Python 3.8+ (for FastMCP and MCP-compatible tools)



Node.js (optional, for certain MCP server implementations)



FastMCP for building and testing MCP servers



MCP Inspector for testing MCP server functionality
